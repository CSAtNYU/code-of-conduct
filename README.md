# Code of Conduct

CSAtNYU is a student communication platform maintained by volunteers. It is in no way officially affiliated with New York University.

## Conduct

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
- Handles are tied to your NYU email address, so please use your real name.
- Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the Citizen Code of Conduct; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of any of the CSAtNYU moderation team immediately. Whether you're a regular participant or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.

1. Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked off the platform to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In the CSAtNYU community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better â€” remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow CSAtNYU members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about how to make the best of our experience at NYU. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

## Academic Dishonesty

_CSAtNYU maintains the same standard for Academic Integrity as NYU. CSAtNYU is a platform for meeting and discussing shared interests with other NYU students, not a platform for sharing answers to exams or for colluding on assignments. Members suspected of any forms of cheating will be banned from this platform. Below is the text that is also seen on the NYU Graduate School's Computer Science Department's policy towards Academic Dishonesty ([link](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Graduate/academic_dishonesty.html))._

The Department of Computer Science takes academic dishonesty to be an unacceptable breach of conduct. We will not tolerate any form of cheating or plagiarism. Students are expected to conduct their work with the highest integrity and to avoid behaviors that jeopardize their own or other's educational progress.

Academic disciplinary violations include, but are not limited to:

- Collaborating on work intended to be done individually.
- Collaborating on work, when permitted by the instructor, but not indicating that the work was a collaboration or not indicating with whom you collaborated.
- Providing your work to someone else, unless specifically allowed by the instructor and properly attributed.
- Submitting the same assignment to two different classes, unless specifically allowed by both instructors.
- Having someone else do your assignments for you. Also asking someone else to do your assignments for you.
- Doing someone else's assignments for them.
- Submitting work based on other people's work without attribution. Ideas, algorithms, text, code, and experimental results all require proper attribution.
- Looking at someone else's test during an exam or asking someone during the exam for help.
- Possessing an unauthorized copy of an exam.
- Using unauthorized technology to get answers during an exam.
- Telling someone what answers to enter on their assignments.
- Students providing information and those using it are ALL cheating and will ALL be subject to disciplinary action.

Disciplinary actions vary in severity, and can result in probation and/or expulsion. For a complete outline of sanctions and procedures, please refer to [Topic 3: Discipline](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/OASL/policiesprocedures/GSAS%20Policies%20and%20Procedures%20november%202004.pdf) in the GSAS Policies and Procedures Manual. 

The departmental policy is to grant an automatic grade of F in the course in which the cheating occurred. The penalty for a second offense is termination from the graduate program.
